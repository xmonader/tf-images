# Funkwhale for ThreeFold Grid

This Directory contains the configuration files and setup required to deploy **Funkwhale**, a self-hosted, decentralized audio platform. The directory includes Docker Compose files, service scripts, and configurations necessary for running Funkwhale.


## Building the Funkwhale Image

- ### To build the Docker image for Funkwhale, you can follow these steps:

 #### Build the Docker image and tag it for the threefolddev repository::
```
cd tf-image/tfgrid3/funkwhale/ 
docker build -t threefolddev/funkwhale:$FUNKWHALE_VERSION .
```
#### Log in to the Docker registry:
```docker login ```
#### Push the image to the threefolddev account:
```docker push threefolddev/funkwhale:$FUNKWHALE_VERSION```

#### Convert the docker image to Zero-OS flist
Convert the docker image to Flist is using [Docker Hub Converter tool](https://hub.grid.tf/docker-convert), make sure you already built and pushed the docker image to docker hub before using this tool.


## Environment Variables

Several environment variables need to be configured before deploying Funkwhale. SMTP configuration is optionalâ€”if not configured, Funkwhale will still function, but it will not send any emails (e.g., notifications, password resets).

### **Required for Basic Functionality**
- `FUNKWHALE_SUPERUSER_NAME`: The username for the Funkwhale superuser.
- `FUNKWHALE_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`: The email for the superuser account.
- `FUNKWHALE_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: The password for the superuser account.
- `Domain`: The domain name for the Funkwhale instance (e.g., `funkwhale.example.com`).
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: A unique secret key for Django. This environment variable is generated automatically by the **start script**.

### **Optional for SMTP Configuration**
If you want Funkwhale to send emails, such as notifications or password resets, you need to configure the following variables:

- `EMAIL_HOST`: The SMTP server address (e.g., `smtp.sendgrid.net`).
- `EMAIL_PORT`: The port used by the SMTP server (e.g., `587`).
- `EMAIL_USERNAME`: The username for SMTP authentication (e.g., `apikey` for SendGrid).
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: The password or API key for SMTP authentication.
- `EMAIL_PROTOCOL`: The protocol used for email communication. Supported options:
  - `smtp`: Plain SMTP communication.
  - `smtp+ssl`: SMTP with SSL encryption (port `465`).
  - `smtp+tls`: SMTP with TLS encryption (port `587`).
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`: The default sender email address (e.g., `peter@funkwhale-test.com`).

If these variables are not set, Funkwhale will default to outputting emails to the console (`consolemail://`), and emails will not actually be sent.

### **Passing Environment Variables**
These environment variables are passed via `.env` files or Zinit service configurations. Ensure they are set properly before deployment to guarantee correct operation.
